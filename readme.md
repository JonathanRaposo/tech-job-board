 # Tech Job Board
 [See live version](https://tech-job-board.fly.dev/)
 
 Tech Job Board consists of a website used by employers to advertise job openings of their companies to web developers. At the same time, web developers can use this job board to search for new jobs and specific companies in the tech industry.

 The app is easy to use. Developers can go to the website, search for jobs and immediately see those job positions pop up. They can look it up by title, company name or keyword.

Employers will have to create an account to make those job posts, view or edit them. Once a developer submits their application, employers will be able to see their application in their profile and eventually contact them for interviews.
  In short, we choose to build this app to enable developers find jobs within the web development field but also make it easy and straightforward for companies to advertise their job vacancies.
